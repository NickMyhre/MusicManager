# MusicManager

This project is still currently under construction.

Initially this started out without classes but I have since converted the entire application to a more object-oriented approach.

The main purpose of this application is to allow a user to manage music data in a MySQL database. There are 3 entities in the application: Albums, Artists, and Songs. The Artist entity has a many to many relation with the other entities. There is a page to display individual information about each entity as well as pages for displaying lists of all entities of a specific type. Validation is present in some areas but not all.

The database consists of 5 tables. 3 of which are for the entities and the other two that keep track of the relationships between the artists and the other entities. 

Technologies and lanugages used in this application include HTML, CSS, PHP, BootStrap, MySQL, and Apache web server. The environment was largely set up via XAMPP.

If you'd like to see what the application looks like screenshots are posted in the "Screenshots" directory.
